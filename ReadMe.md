#Mark Blanford Vending Machine Code Kata

###Description

This submission is not a complete version of the Vending Machine Code Kata.

As this test was requested in Java/JavaScript, I was limited in my ability to complete all aspects of the test by the fact that the Java portion of the CodeClan course did not cover database integration, nor did it cover front-end integration (other than Android).

I completed and tested the business logic in Java, as should be demonstrable in this submission. However, despite extensive research and looking at various tutorials, I was unable to find resources at the appropriate level to help me understand how best to approach the aforementioned issues.

Rather than taking longer to experiment, I felt it best and most representative to submit the completed material I was comfortable with.

The project was created and tested in IntelliJ IDEA, and should be runnable as is.
